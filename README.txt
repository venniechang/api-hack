This is my iteration of a currency converter. Imagine you are thinking of traveling out of country and would like to know which countries
are still within budget to explore. My project applies two different API's that will:

1. Convert your home country's currency to those you wish to convert to.
2. Find the banks nearest you so you can exchange your currency before leaving the country.

This will help many travelers and explorers with money budgeting and also conveniently providing places to exchange money.
